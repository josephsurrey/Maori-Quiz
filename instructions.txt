To begin, you will need to select one of three available quizzes. The quizzes are categorized into different topics. The available options are:

- Maori Numbers
- Maori Months
- Maori Days of the Week

Once you have decided on a quiz, type the corresponding number (1, 2, or 3) on your keyboard and press Enter to confirm your selection.

After selecting a quiz, the game will present you with a series of multiple-choice questions. Each question will have four possible answers labeled as options A, B, C, and D.

To answer a question, type the letter corresponding to your chosen answer (a, b, c, or d) on your keyboard and press Enter to submit your response.

The game will provide instant feedback on your answer. If you answer correctly, you will receive points and move on to the next question. If you answer incorrectly, the correct answer will be revealed before moving to the next question.

You will continue answering questions until you have completed the entire quiz.
